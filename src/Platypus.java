public class Platypus {
//	Objects have a name, member variables, and methods. Before you can use an object in your program, you usually have to create an instance of it. This is done using a constructor. Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to and are preceded by new when called. 
//
//	Unlike other methods, constructors do not have a return type, but they can receive parameter values. Constructors have been used in Level 0 recipes to create Robot and Random objects, and in Level 1 recipes to create UI objects as shown below:
//
//	new Robot("mini")
//	new Random()
//
//	new JFrame()
//	new JButtton("click me")
//
//	Constructors are further explained in the following video: Java Constructors Tutorial
//
//
//
//	Use a runner class (a class with a main method) to create a Platypus object in your deafult Java project.
//
//	1. First create the Platypus class as shown below.
//
//	public class Platypus {
	      private String name;
//
	      	void sayHi(){
	            	System.out.println("The platypus " + name + " is smarter than your average platypus.");
	      	}
	      	Platypus(String name){
	      		this.name=name;
	      	}
//	}
//
//	2. Create another Java class. This will be a "runner" or "driver" class, so it will need a main method.
//
//	3. In your runner class, make a new instance of a Platypus
//
//	4. Call the sayHi() method - see what happens
//
//	5. Create a constructor in the Platypus class that takes a name parameter, so that you can give your Platypus a name.
//
//	6. Change your code above to call the new constructor 
}
